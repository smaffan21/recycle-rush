## About The Project

Our goal was to build an innovative game aimed at promoting some of the 17 Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). Taking on the role of project lead, I conceptualized the main idea of the game with my team, building upon my previous experience with Unity & C#. We decided to take a unique approach to build our game primarily focused on the functionality and entertainment, keeping the education side of things more implicit. 

With the use of Unity, we developed "Recycle Rush", a captivating mobile game designed for children aged 5-11. We cleverly incorporated disguised "pods" of education within the game, educating players about the significance of ethics in recycling. By tracking the score in kilowatt-hours (kWh) instead of traditional points and replacing checkpoints with enjoyable quizzes, we made the learning experience entertaining.
